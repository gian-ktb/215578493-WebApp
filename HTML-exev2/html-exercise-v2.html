            <h1>Humanity's Strongest Soldier</h1>
            <p>"I don't know the answer to that. I never have. Whether I trusted myself or the choices of my dependable comrades, there was no telling how things would turn out. So, just do the best you can and choose whichever you'll regret the least."</p>
            <p><b>Levi Ackermann</b>, often formally referred to as Captain, is the squad captain ("leader of the soldiers") of the Special Operations Squad within the Scout Regiment, and is said to be humanity's strongest soldier.</p>

            <h2 id="Overview">OVERVIEW</h2>
            <p>After Erwin and most of the Scouts fall, Levi takes out the surrounding Titans and engages Zeke. Zeke attempts to crush Levi, who merely dodges, slicing up the Titan's arm to pieces in the process. Levi then proceeds to slash the Beast Titan's eyes, blinding it, then cuts up its ankles which causes it to topple over. Slicing open the nape, Levi thrusts his blade into Zeke's mouth, commenting that his body is heavily damaged after transforming into a Titan so Zeke can not transform again while he is busy healing it. Further thrusting his blade right through Zeke's cheek and above his right eye, Levi decides he cannot kill him yet, pondering over whether there are anyone still alive who he would use the Titan injection on and have them eat Zeke to steal his Titan power.</p>
